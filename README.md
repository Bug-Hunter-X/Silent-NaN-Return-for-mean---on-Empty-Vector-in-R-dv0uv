This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in R: the silent return of NaN (Not a Number) when calculating the mean of an empty numeric vector. The `bug.R` file contains the erroneous code, which fails to handle the case of an empty vector and silently produces NaN. The `bugSolution.R` file provides a solution which addresses this issue by explicitly checking for the empty vector scenario before applying the mean function. This prevents unexpected behavior and improves the robustness of your R code.
